# THIS IS THE EXPERIMENTAL BRANCH
All things testing and junk related
or things that will break master and
anything that is not directly related
to the use of gnu-autotools should go here.
This is useful for experimenting/re-writing
large sections of code with some saftey net,
so to speak. Will be fun!

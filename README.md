# Messy Foods
Inspired by a delicious breakfast of bacon eggs toast and coffe.

##Basic storyline:
You are eating breakfast, a normal everyday event. Suddenly, you drop 
some toast and egg crumbs in your bowl. Your cereal is not happy. In 
protest, they start chucking flakes and O's at you. This has made a huge 
mess! And now you've been dragged down into the depths of Messy Foods,
to determine which food is breakfast king.

##How to play:
Left mouse - Chuck cereal

Right mouse - Activate paper towel

Mouse movement - Aim

##Features:
-Full GNU autotools support. This should make compiling/installing a breeze

-Destructible coffee filter

-Unique mechanics like paper towel

-Wave based gameplay

-Basic player health bar or "HUD" if you can call it that

-Reasonably accurate collision models

###Upcoming features:
-Additional enemies

-Powerups

-Improved audio

-Miscellaneous graphical enhancments. I hope to learn how to use shaders, but this is not a very high priority.

##Technical requirements
###I'm a hobby Linux developer, so Windows of any kind is unsupported. If you can make it work for Windows, great!
In order to play this, you will need the SFML 2.4.0-1 runtime libraries, available from http://www.sfml-dev.org/
or your package manager. This project may run against older versions of SFML, however, 2.4.0-1 is the version I am 
building against. You will also  need a C++ compiler. A makefile has been included in the src/ directory, and
should allow you to compile the project. Any bug reports or refinements to the makefile are welcome,as I don't 
normally use one.

##NOTES:
I made a point of making all the artwork myself, using gimp. If you believe there has been a copyright infringement,
please contact me and we will settle it right away. This also means you are free to use all of my art, subject to the MIT license. I'll try to include .xcf (open source image) whenever it makes sense to do so.

Included is the electronic highway sign font from: 
http://www.dafont.com/theme.php?cat=302&page=2
The font description says "100%" free so I hope that means I can include it here. :)

I've made a point of making some, but not all, of the audio myself. Some audio files have been taken from www.freesound.org
Where this occured, I explicitly checked that the license was creative commons 0, thus (hopefully) allowing me to freely
include the audio with my project. Again if you have any problems, email me.

I've used space invaders as a reference and inspiration for this project, and as a reference and inspiration only. I take
no credit for the original space invaders released by Taito in 1978.
